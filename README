Scalable Resilient Overlay Networks
===================================

The SRON project is a collaboration between researchers from MIT and CMU to
make [Resilient Overlay Networks] scale up to hundreds of nodes by applying a
novel distributed algorithm for efficient (near-optimal) one-hop link-state
routing in such full-mesh networks as RONs.  Prior techniques for this setting
scale poorly, as each node incurs quadratic communication overhead to broadcast
its link state to all other nodes.  In contrast, in our algorithm each node
exchanges routing state with only a small subset of overlay nodes determined by
using a quorum system.  Using a two-round protocol, each node can find an
optimal one-hop path to any other node using only n-root-n per-node
communication.  Our algorithm can also be used to find the optimal
shortest-path of arbitrary length using n-root-n-log-n per-node communication.
The algorithm is designed to be resilient to both node and link failures.

For more details, please refer to our paper, "Scaling all-pairs overlay routing
to the thousands," which appears in [CoNext 2009].  This codebase is the
published system that was developed to prototype and experimentally evaluate
the algorithm on [PlanetLab].

Getting Started
===============

The only requirement for this system is Java 6.

To build, run `make`.

The tool to regenerate the message type source code is `object-codegen` and is
found here:

https://assorted.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/assorted/object-codegen/trunk/src

Instead of adopting a serialization framework such as [Protocol Buffers], we
chose to exercise greater control over a simpler serialization format.

Eventually we will also release our PlanetLab-based experiment orchestration
code to facilitate experiment re-creation.
